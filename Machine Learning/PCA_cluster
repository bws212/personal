CLustering and PCA are both low cost, unsupervised methods to group data
Types of clustering: k-means, agglorimization?, db-scan
db-scan is density based, best when looking for patterns, but not necessarily everything else

Pre-process w PCA or clustering unsupervised methods
Give both raw data and data based on principal components to see differences in performances
Can do this with NMF, clustering, PCA, etc(other unsupervised pre-processing methods) to see if one works better
