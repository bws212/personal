Title: ML-Edex-4STEM: Teaching and applying machine learning to physical science students

abstract: This poster describes an effort to develop pedagogical materials for teaching machine learning to physical science students.  The premise is that physical scientists have significant training in mathematics, especially algebra and calculus, but less exposure to the statistics and linear algebra needed for ML.  they also are motivated by physical science problems rather than categorizing cat and dog images or predicting housing prices or interesting movies.  They would therefore benefit from course materials that are designed to play to their strengths and interests.   With funding help from the collaboratory@columbia University we have developed a set of "Educational examples" or Edexes that take real examples from the physial science literature and right-size them as an educational example (i.e., so they can be computed on a laptop in reasonable time).  These are chosen so that different concepts in ML can be rolled out but on real problems from the literature.  The initial suite of Edexes come from the materials science field and include predicting melting points of materials from structural descriptors using linear regression models (and clustering), predicting the the symmetry space-group of a material from its measured x-ray diffraction data using logistic regression and a convolutional neural net, predicting a new polymer material with exceptional gas-separation properties from a library of monomers (molecular sub-units) using linear regression and intepretaive ML, as well as unsupervised ML using PCA and non negative matrix factorization on time-resolved chemical synthesis data. The course is being taught for the first time this spring as MSAE4990.  Class members will present the materials, and share their experiences and impressions.
