PCA
Form a basis, lin ind. set
The basis is essentially eigenvectors.. Amount is some eigenvalue*eigenvector
Like if you have three chemical components, and they are combining etc, 
3 components are eigenvectors, amount over tiem is eigenvalues, scaling these three components along their eigenvector etc.
ALl signals from diffraction can be written as lin. comb. of the three compositions, with an eigenvalue for each of the 3 eigenvectors
So we can use PCA to find the eigenvectors, and keep the ones with the highest eigenvalues to form a basis for our dataset


Gas Perm:
Either high flow rate low selectivity, or very high selectivity and very low flow rate,,, selectivity vs. permeability
But we want very high selectivity and flow rate, so we need new materials:
Use mL to find a material with these properties
Luory Distribution
New materials, either doesn't exist or we haven't tried it, focus on "we haven't tried it"
One-hot Encoding
SMILES: Way of representing molecules as vectors: 1-D code of characters which codes for molecule, conversion between code and molecules
Store in database^^
"SMILES string": all sitting in some database in this format
issue is that length of SMILE strings depends on chemical composition and structure, so it gets weird
So we need to fingerprint --> take something and turn it into fixed value numeric
In this case: Hashing
A hash is a function that will take variable length things and map them onto fixed length data objects
variables length things go into hash functions and come out as fixed length HASH, ideally come out as unique hash so we can unhash, etc
RDkit: hash function that takes SMILE string and returns a Boolean hash
Merkle tree and hashes are used for crypto currency
Get comfortable with SMILE strings/ material informatics... hashes etc...
