# training

Welcome to Cl√ºb Steingart's training repo. It is rather minimalistic and intended solely as an exercise. See our [notion manual](https://www.notion.so/ceecnyc/Git-GOGS-bed8b705ea6e4423a23ba6eac2977e80?pvs=4) for details on terminology etc.

## Exercise 1: Basic workflow

1. Clone this repo to your local machine: `$ git clone https://gogs.ceec.echem.io/clubsteingart/training.git`


2. Note that the repo is going to be nested in your current directory. Open the directory: `$ cd training`


3. Create a new branch. Call it something distinctive, like your name: `$ git checkout -b <branch_name>`


4. Create a new file/s. Go wild and write something clever.


5. Now let's get ready to push the changes back to GOGS. First, let's add whichever files you want to push: `$ git add <filename>`


6. Commit the changes: `$ git commit -m "your message"`


7. Push the changes to GOGS: `$ git push origin <branch_name>`


8. Congrats! You're a hacker bro now.
